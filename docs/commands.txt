mwlib Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common Options
==============

This section contains a description of options that are accepted by more than
one command.

``-h, --help``

  Show usage information and exit.

``-c, --conf=CONF``

  The value for this option describes the source of MediaWiki articles and
  images for the command and can be of one of the following types:

  * A "base URL" of a MediaWiki installation. A base URL is the URL up to, but
    not including the ``index.php``/``api.php`` part.
  
    This URL can differ from
    the prefix seen in "pretty" article URLs. For example the article *Physics*
    in the English Wikipedia has the URL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics,
    but the base URL is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/.
  
    If you've set up your own
    MediaWiki you probably know what your base URL should be, but if you're
    using a different MediaWiki, you can see the base URL if add a query string
    to the URL, e.g. by cicking on the edit link or by looking at an older
    revision of an article.
  
    This value for ``--config`` corresponds to ``type=mwapi`` in a configuration
    file (see below), i.e. articles and images are fetched with the
    `MediaWiki API`_. Speciffying the URL directly as value for ``--config``
    is usually the quicker way to achieve exactly the same result.
  
  * A shortcut for a base URL. Currently there are the following shortcuts:

    - ":en" -- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/, i.e. the English Wikipedia
    - ":de" -- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/, i.e. the German Wikipedia

  * A filename of a ZIP file generated with the `the mw-zip Command`_.
  
  * A filename of a configuration file (see `Configuration Files`_).

``-m, --metabook=METABOOK``

  Description of the article colleciton to be rendered in JSON format.
  This is used by the `Collection extension`_ to transfer this information
  to ``mw-serve`` which in turn passes the information to ``mw-render`` and
  ``mw-zip``.

``--collectionpage=COLLECTIONPAGE``

  Title of a saved article collection (using the `Collection extension`_)

``-x, --no-images``

  If given, no images are included in the output document.

``--template-blacklist=TEMPLATE_BLACKLIST``

  A name of an article containing a list of "blacklisted templates", i.e.
  MediaWiki templates that should be discarded during rendering.

``-o, --output=OUTPUT``

  Write output to given file.

``-l, --logfile=LOGFILE``

  Log output to the given file.

``-d, --daemonize``

  Become a daemon process as soon as possible. This doesn't work on Windows.

The ``mw-render`` Command
=========================

Render MediaWiki articles to one of several output formats like PDF of
OpenDocument Text.

Usage
-----
::

  mw-render [OPTIONS] [ARTICLETITLE...]

Specific Options

  can be seen with ``mw-render --list-writers``.

``--list-writers``

  List the available writers.
  
``-W, --writer-options``

  Writer specific options in a ";" separated list (depending on your shell,
  quoting with "..." or '...' might be needed). Each item in that list can
  either be a single option or an option=value pair. To list the available
  writer options use ``mw-render --writer-info WRITERNAME``.

``--writer-info=WRITER``

  Show avaiable options and some additional information about the given writer.

``-s, --status-file=STATUS_FILE``

  Write status/progress information in JSON format to this file. The file
  is continuously updated during the execution of ``mw-render``.

``-e, --error-file=ERROR_FILE``

  If an error occurs, write the error message to this file. If no error occurs
  this file is not written/created.


The ``mw-zip`` Command
======================

Generate a ZIP file containing

 * articles,
 * images,
 * templates and
 * additional meta information (especially if ``--metabook`` is given, see
   `Common Options`_) like name and URL of the MediaWiki, licensing information
   and title, subtitle and the hierarchical structure of the article collection.

Usage
-----
::

  mw-zip [OPTIONS] [ARTICLETITLE...]
  
Specific Options
----------------

``-i, --imagesize=IMAGESIZE``

  Maximum size (which can be either width or height, whichever is greater) of
  images. If images exceed this maximum size, they're scaled down.
  
``-p, --posturl=POSTURL``

``-g , --getposturl``

  Retrieve the POSTURL from PediaPress and open the upload page in the web
  browser.


The ``mw-serve`` Command
========================

Provide a server interface to ``mw-render`` and ``mw-zip``. This can be used
in conjuction with the `Collection extension`_ to provide PDF generation or
the possibility to order printed books from a MediaWiki.

Usage
-----
::

  mw-serve [OPTIONS]

Specific Options
----------------

``-P, --protocol=PROTOCOL``

  Protocol to serve. The value can be one of "http", "fcgi" (FastCGI),
  "scgi" or "cgi". If the value is "cgi", ``mw-serve`` is actually no server
  at all but will be run by the driving web serve once for each request.

``-p, --port=PORT``

  For protocols other than ``cgi``, listen on this TCP port. The default value
  is 8899.

``-i, --interface=INTERFACE``

  For protocols other than ``cgi``, listen on this interface. The default value
  is "0.0.0.0".

``--cache-dir=CACHE_DIR``

  Cache directory. This directory must be writeable by the ``mw-serve`` process.

``--mwrender``

  Path to the ``mw-render`` executable. The default is just "mw-render" which
  is ok, as long as ``mw-render`` is in the ``PATH``.

``--mwrender-logfile``

  Logfile for ``mw-render``. Default is "/var/log/mw-render.log". The file must
  be writeable.

``--mwzip``

  Path to the ``mw-zip`` executable. The default is just "mw-zip" which
  is ok, as long as ``mw-zip`` is in the ``PATH``.

``--mwzip-logfile``

  Logfile for ``mw-zip``. Default is "/var/log/mw-zip.log". The file must
  be writeable.


Configuration Files
===================

Configuration files are in a `INI-like format`_. They can contain the sections

``[wiki]``

  Description of how to retrieve MediaWiki articles and templates and meta
  information about the MediaWiki like name or URL.

and

``[images]``

  Description of how to retrieve images.

Both sections must contain a ``type`` setting, on which all other available
settings in that section depend. ``type`` can be one of the following values:

``type=mwapi``

  Retrieve articles and images via the `MediaWiki API`_, i.e. via ``api.php``.
  The following settings must be present:
  
  ``base_url=BASEURL``

    The base URL of the MediaWiki. See the ``--conf`` option in `Common Options`_.
    
  ``template_blacklist=TEMPLATEBLACKLIST``

    A title of a page in the MediaWiki which contains blacklisted templates.
